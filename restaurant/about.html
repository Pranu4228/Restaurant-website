    Reminiscent of butcher shops back in the day, each slow-smoked, sizzling prime chop measures seven-fingers high.
     Our signature recipe, that we have perfected for more than four decades, is rubbed with a secret blend of seasonings, cured
     and roasted on a rotisserie with pecan wood for up to six hours before it’s topped with (RN) signature herb-garlic butter, 
    then carved tableside.</p>
